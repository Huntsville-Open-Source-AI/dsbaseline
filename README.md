# Setup

### Create a repository from this template

1. Click the big green button `Use this template` or click <a href="../../generate">here</a>.
1. Enter a Repository name and click `Create repository from template`
1. Head over to the created repository and complete the setup.

### Complete setup

1. In the a new repository, <a href="../../edit/main/cookiecutter.json">complete the project setup</a> by editing the `cookiecutter.json` file. 
1. Hit <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> and then <kbd>Enter</kbd> to perform a commit (the commit message doesn't really matter).
1. Wait <a href="../../actions">Setup Repository Action</a> to complete.

# What is this all about?

On June 6, 2019, [GitHub introduced Repository Templates](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) giving users an easy way to share boilerplate for their projects. This feature is fantastic, but lacking adoption to my knowledge and opinion for one reason... [Read the full blog post](https://stefanbuck.com/blog/repository-templates-meets-github-actions) to learn how to template new projects using repository templates and GitHub Actions.# Cookiecutter Data Science

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work._


#### [Project homepage](http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/)


### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 2.7 or 3.5+
 - [Cookiecutter Python package](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with pip by or conda depending on how you manage your Python packages:

``` bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

or

``` bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
$ conda install cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

    cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science


[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/244658.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/244658)

### New version of Cookiecutter Data Science
------------
Cookiecutter data science is moving to v2 soon, which will entail using
the command `ccds ...` rather than `cookiecutter ...`. The cookiecutter command
will continue to work, and this version of the template will still be available.
To use the legacy template, you will need to explicitly use `-c v1` to select it.
Please update any scripts/automation you have to append the `-c v1` option (as above),
which is available now.


### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project looks like this:
